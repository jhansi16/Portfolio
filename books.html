                    <p><i><strong>Reading makes a full man</strong></i> is a famous quote by the English philosopher
                        Sir Francis Bacon and no
                        other inspirational words were said, in order to defeat it. Based on my perspective,
                        pretty much everything in the world can be learned and understood by reading books. Of course,
                        some books are interesting and some are boring. It doesnâ€™t matter what the genre you would love
                        to read, there is nothing more relaxing than spending with an interesting book in a calm place
                        alone. It brings me to a world I could not imagine. However, all the other subject related
                        books really help me to understand deep concepts behind the things hard to understand. As a
                        Student, reading books as a part of my daily schedule.</p>
